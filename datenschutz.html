          interest in the most reliable presentation of our website. Provided that a corresponding

          GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as consent requires the storage of cookies or access to

          3. General information and mandatory information

          <br>
          The operators of these sites take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your

          personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations, as well as

          and for what purpose this is done.

          We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail)

          creates vulnerabilites in the security. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not

          possible.

          the latter case, the deletion takes place after these reasons have ceased to exist.

          performance of a contract is necessary if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. disclosure of data

          to tax authorities) if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR

          or if there is another legal basis for the transfer of data.

          revoke consent already given at any time. The lawfulness of the actions carried out prior to the revocation

          Data processing remains unaffected by the revocation.

          EVIDENCE WHICH OVERRIDES THEIR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR WHICH

          PROCESSING SERVES THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENCE OF

          LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).

          Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority

          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a

          supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work

          or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other

          administrative or judicial remedies.

          this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.


          <br> <br>
          Information, correction and deletion

          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to - free of charge at any time, request information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the

          If you contest the accuracy of your personal data held by us, we need some time to check this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to

          request restriction of processing of your personal data.

          If the processing of your personal data has been/is unlawful, you may

          request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.

          If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,

          defence or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to take action in lieu of the

          request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

          If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between

          your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests

          you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data

          to demand.

          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may not be processed by

          their storage – only with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or

          defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or

          of a Member State.

          SSL or TLS encryption

          For example, orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, an SSL or TLS_Verschlüsselung. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address bar of the browser is

          "http://" changes to "https://" and click on the lock icon in your browser line.

          <br>
          Server Log Files

          The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server Log_Dateien, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:

          Browser type and browser version

          Operating system used

          Referrer URL

          Host name of the accessing computer

          Time of server request

          IP address

          This data is not combined with other data sources.

          This data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Website Operator has

          a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimisation of its website –

          for this purpose, the server log files must be recorded.

          <br> <br>

          Contact

          If you send us enquiries via the contact form, your details will be retrieved from the

          Enquiry form including the contact details you provide there for the purpose of processing the enquiry

          and in case of follow-up questions. We do not share this data without your

          consent.

          The processing of this data is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, provided that your enquiry is linked to

          the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.

          is required. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the

          effective processing of enquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your

          Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; consent is given at any time

          revocable.

          The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you notify us for deletion.

          revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for which the data was stored no longer applies.

          (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions –

          in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.
